# Unreal_TD_3

Small project for creating a Laser Beam VFX with Unreal Niagara System.

I based this VFX on https://www.artstation.com/artwork/oOl6kL

No asset were added to the project.

Everything in the VFX is tied to the simulated position, so you can place your VFX wherever you want inside the game.


## Homemade Materials:

MAT_Circle  -> Simple sphere mask with a particule color

MAT_Star    -> Star shaped material made with math with a "Star Width" parameter of 500 by default

MAT_BigStar -> Instance of MAT_Star with a "Star Width" parameter of 250

MAT_Test    -> Just having fun with this one
